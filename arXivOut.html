electrons up to a few PeV ($10^{15} \ \rm eV$), close to the maximum energy
allowed by theory. The physical conditions in the acceleration site and the
nature of the acceleration process itself remain highly uncertain. The key
information about the highest energy accelerated particles is contained in the
synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) channels of radiation at energies above
1~MeV and 100~TeV, respectively. The recent report of detection of ultra-high
energy gamma-ray signal from the Crab Nebula up to 300~TeV allows one to
determine the energy distribution of the highest energy electrons and to derive
the magnetic field strength in the acceleration region, $B\leq120\rm\,\mu G$,
in a parameter-free way. This estimate brings new constraints on the properties
of non-thermal particle distributions and puts important constraints on the MHD
models for the Crab Nebula, in particular on the feasible magnetization and
anisotropy of the pulsar wind. The calculations of synchrotron and IC emission
show that future observations with instruments allowing detection of the Crab
Nebula above 300~TeV and above 1~MeV will clarify the conditions allowing
acceleration of electrons beyond PeV energies in the Crab Nebula. In
particular, one will (1) verify the hypothetical multi-component composition of
the electron energy distribution, and (2) determine the magnetic field strength
in the regions responsible for the acceleration of PeV electrons.</div></section>

collision of a magnetized anisotropic pulsar wind with the circumbinary
environment. We focus on studying the impact of the high wind magnetization on
the geometrical structure of the shocked flow. This work is an extension of our
earlier studies that focused on a purely hydrodynamic interaction and weak wind
magnetization. We consider the collision in the axisymmetric approximation,
that is, the pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line
between the pulsar and the optical star. The increase of the magnetization
results in the expansion of the opening cone in which the shocked pulsar wind
propagates. This effect is explained in the frameworks of the conventional
theory of collimation of magnetized winds. This finding has a direct
implication for scenarios that involve Doppler boosting as the primary
mechanism behind the GeV flares detected with the Fermi/LAT from PSR
B1259-63/LS2883. The maximum enhancement of the apparent emission is determined
by the ratio of $4\pi$ to the solid in which the shocked pulsar wind
propagates. Our simulations suggest that this enhancement factor is decreased
by the impact of the magnetic field.</div></section>

flares, up to 30 times increase in flux, were observed in the MeV and GeV
energy range by the AGILE and Fermi Gamma-ray Observatories. Existing nebula
models often assume that the electron population emitting synchrotron radiation
at lower energies is responsible for the VHE emission via Inverse Compton (IC)
scattering. This suggests that the variability of the synchrotron $\gamma$-ray
emission may also become observable in the multi-TeV energy range. Until now,
no variability in the Crab Nebula flux has been found in the VHE regime. In
2015, MAGIC started an observational campaign which improved the collection
efficiency of $\gamma$-rays above several tens of TeV. These observations are
performed under Very Large Zenith Angles (VLZA) and lead to a large increase in
the collection area. This allows us to observe the low fluxes at TeV energies
in a shorter time compared to standard observations, and to significantly
increase the observable energy towards higher energies. We have studied the
Crab Nebula light curve obtained from the VLZA data since 2015 in search for
the flux variability at the highest TeV energies. The results of this study
will be presented.</div></section>
